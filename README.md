# Address-Book
A sample address book website realized with PHP sessions and implemented through **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern design.

I used **Apache** through **XAMPP Control Panel** as the engine to run PHP files.

Please, note that the **Model** directory is missing because there is no database in the project.
